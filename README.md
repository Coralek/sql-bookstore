# Bookstore

this is a small SQL project where I model a simple bookstore database.
i made it mainly for learning and practice.

## idea

i wanted to practice SQL on something realistic, so i picked a simple topic and tried to model the data from scratch.
the goal was to think about tables, relations, and how things connect, not to make a perfect design.

## next steps

* add analysis queries
* maybe connect it with python and do some basic visualizations

Nothing fancy, just learning and experimenting 🙂
